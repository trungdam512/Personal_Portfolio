Coming into this March Madness data set, I was curious about the influence of past performances/participation on public favorite picks and championship aura among 64 D1 Basketball Programs. Two research questions are:

1.  Would the amount of times the team advances to a certain round influence the public picks for the time to win a game in that round?
2.  Are teams with more experience in previous tournaments likely to have championship genes?

Tag along with me to see what the data got to tell us!
