Our project features a traditional Burkina Faso game, which includes two players placing and taking turns to move 3 markers. Our code requires users to install Java 17 to use kilt-graphics, a graphic library developed by the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science (MSCS) department in Macalester College: <https://mac-comp127.github.io/kilt-graphics/index.html>.

To play the game, users should first log their name into name boxes. Then the game takes the players to a board screen, which requires them to place 3 markers by turn. Using a computer mouse, one player must move their markers smartly to form a row, a column, or a diagonal line to win the game. The players can further change their names and play the game over again.
